# Hi! My name is Connor Adams!

[//]: <> (Quick bio summary)
Welcome to my GitHub! I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from Cal Poly Pomona. Currently, I am actively seeking to grow my knowledge in the data analytics field by enhancing my skills in handling big data, creating and maintaining data pipelines, and exploring machine learning and statistical models using various tools such as Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. Follow me to see what I am currently working on, and hopefully we can work together on some projects.
